                    <li>Local storage: This is a mechanism that allows web apps to store data in the user's web browser.
                        The data stored in local storage stays stored even after the browser is closed and reopened.

                        only accessible in the same browser tab or window, and it is cleared when the tab or window is

                        checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack,
                        waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                <div class="text-xl font-normal flex flex-col gap-2">
                    <p>
                        The quizTimer function is a timer that counts up from 0 and displays the time in minutes and
                        seconds. It also changes the color of the timer every 60 seconds and it is updated every 1000ms
                        or 1s.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        The function called quizTimer takes a single parameter called dismiss. The function uses an
                        arrow function syntax and is assigned to a constant variable.At first there is a condition, that
                        checks whether the dismiss parameter is truthy or falsy, and if it is truthy then the inner
                        block of code gets executed and it clears the timer interval then returns the function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The function updates the timer display by incrementing a count variable and converting it to
                        minutes and seconds. countHtml gets the element which has the id "count". There's a global
                        variable called count which was declared in the index.js file with a initial value of 0. The
                        covtMin converts the value of count which is updated every second. covtMin uses Math.floor on
                        the (count/60) part to get the floor value of the divided number which gives us the time in
                        seconds.
                        Then the mod just uses %(modulus) to mod the count by 60. We get minutes and seconds from the
                        mod and the covtMin variables. Although they both have ternary operations in them so basically
                        we are converting from integer to string and checking the length of the string. If it is 1 that
                        means the seconds are in single digits then we give the seconds with a 0 in front of the single
                        digit second value. If not then we give the seconds which consists of double or more digits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we set the inner html of the countHTML with the seconds and minutes we got earlier.After
                        this part the count++ increases the value of count by 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now we have a conditional expression to check if the count is greater than 60. Then we nested
                        another conditional expression inside to check if the mod of the count is equal to 0 (both value
                        and type) using triple equal notation.If the condition is truthy then we make the more red by
                        changing the classes of the countHtml. Else we vice-versa the process.

                        The chooseQuiz function takes an index and a given answer as arguments, and updates the answers
                        array with the
                        given answer for the quiz at the specified index. If the quiz has already been answered, the
                        function updates the
                        existing answer. If the quiz has not been answered, the function adds a new answer to the
                        answers array then the answers array is thrown inside the displayAnswer function as the parameter.
